It suggests that something about the campaign or the service as presented may have actively discouraged potential users.\n","- The lack of significant effects on the intent to switch and the change in preference rankings suggests that the campaign did not effectively persuade existing users of other services to consider switching or altering their preferences in favor of the advertised service.\n","- The overall effectiveness of the advertisement in encouraging positive perceptions or actions towards the music streaming service is questioned, particularly given the significant negative impact on the willingness to try the service. This indicates a need to reassess the campaign's messaging, targeting, or the perceived value of the service offered to better align with potential users' expectations and preferences.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## ____________________________________________________________________________"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next Steps:\n","1.
